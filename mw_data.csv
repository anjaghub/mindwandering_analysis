Im aware, that soon, i don’t know exactly when,a friend of mine will come or and we’ll go visit another friend. 
As Im meditating, my thoughts drift away from the focus of my meditation (which I only notice afterwards of course) and I start to mindwander as described in the following. The episode does not last longer than a few seconds, but is very salient, as i do ‚think alot‘ otherwise, right now and I also intent to not think at all. ","As I sit there, expecting my friend to arrive any minute (im explicitly and consciously having this expectation) and from there I think of how the room I’m in would look like from outside the window, looking in from the street. First I have this in my awareness as some kind of ‚question‘, that i ask myself. I have the feeling, that this question was there in a rather unformulated form, I.e. I don’t really think — or i don’t remember — that I heard it, or spoke it Inneres as such.
Following this thought, I imagine the ‚answer‘ to this question: I picture, in my imagination and income form of ‚still image‘, the view from outside into the window of the room — standing on the street‘ into the window. There is a stark contrast between the dark outside and the lit window, creating with its frames some kind of picture on The wall. I see the curtains covering a bit of this ‚picture‘. I also ‚see myself‘ sitting on the bed, as well as the monitor of the PC positioned in a straight line from The window to the other end of the room, ‚in between the desk and the window‘. Then I notice my mindwandering, that i was actually ‚supposed’ to be concentrating on my meditation, as well as that I want to write it down immediately, as I forget these episodes really quickly. 
The Episode in general, felt like a reaction to the question of ‚how the room looks‘ from outside, in which I pictured the answer before my inner eye and from my own perspective. Further, even if there was no social interaction at all, I have the feeling that the Episode also had a social aspect, in that it started with being aware, that in a few minutes at max. My friend will probably arrive. 
I feel like the whole episode was rather neutral, regarding the emotional Range of it. It was mainly a relatively neutral ‚picturing‘, if anything I felt a bit stressed, because of the mentioned — only few — minutes, I have left being alone.",

For this episode, it is very hard to describe, or maybe also just to remember a specific form of my mindwandering, I.e. there wasn’t really a coherent succession of inner speech or hearing, although some impressions i think at least included some visual impression, e.g. there was a ‚flash‘ of a (very ‚blurry‘) image of me looking into the bathroom (from my perspective, standing in the door) but only after explicitly knowing I’ll have to  before going.

I visualize in my head (in some sort of visual scene combined with movement, but without persons) the threads of the bow going over single string making it vibrate and then imagine the hollow body of the violin itself.

I don’t visualize this in any form, but I know that they are very old and that they become better over time.

The first thing I remember of this episode, is one specific situation
From an evening a few years ago, around the same time as now, where I was visiting a friend. On my way there in my memory, I happen to meet a friend of my brother whom I also know very well. We have a short talk and he invites me to come by his place later were he’s hangin out later with my brother, but I’m somewhat in a hurry and the conversation ends kind of awkwardly. This feeling of awkwardness is what I remembered first and what got me into mindwandering through this memory. It feels like in reliving this memory, The chronological succession might be a bit out of line, with the awkward feeling the farewell had presenting the beginning of the episode of mindwandering, but with my memory including stuff before and after that. After that, thinking about the memory now, the absurdity of this awkward situation In retrospective makes me laugh a bit and then I focus back on the book I’m otherwise reading.","
The first instance of this episode is an image of me standing on a separating isle between two lanes on a Main Street. Behind me and in front of me are stoplights and there are around 7 meters of walkway. Here is also where I meet the friend of my brother. In all of this image there is not a lot of detail visually and there is also no real movement or talking as such, and rather only a Rough image of the location and less of the whole event itself.
The whole memory is colored emotionally by a strong feeling of awkwardness/cringe that colors the whole memory. This feeling of awkwardness is also the strongest association I have with the memory.
I also have to think about the interaction preceding this feeling and thinking back, I feel like being in a hurry, as if it is a problem if I don’t continue walking toward the place I’m heading. At the same time I feel like I cannot really walk by the friend I met without engaging for a bit. The same conflicting feeling intensifies during our short conversation as I’m also aware that I probably don’t seem very relaxed, which feels like it inhibits my capacity to communicate well. 
Following the memory, I ponder for a while at this feeling of awkwardness and I actually have to laugh silently, as looking back at it, feels a bit surreal and absurd, without any real explainable reason for being what it was.

It was in the afternoon and it was warmer than the last days. I was listening to a podcast on my headphones, and the traffic was not my focus. Navigating my bicycle through the streets and cars was not a big cognitive challenge. The podcast was about gender differences in dating and sex and about some scientific studies illuminating these fields and how the gamification and capitalisation of dating apps changes how people perceive these things. So I was listening and started mind wandering especially when the topic of young men and their drastic decrease of sexual activity within the last ten years came up. 
It ended a few minutes later (maybe 2-3) when I realized that I didn't listen anymore but I wanted to. So I went back in the podcast to the last thing I remembered.","The mind wandering started with the topic of young men having less sex nowadays than some decades ago. First, I was thinking of some individuals (male friends) who I consider to be in this group of sexually inactive men who actually want to be sexually active but can't and are rejected all the time.  I remember that the people I was talking to changed rapidly. First, it was the male friends, then soon, it was female friends. With the male friends I took a very understanding perspective - with the female ones, I imagined myself to be in the situation where I had to convince them that this is a real issue and that for some reason, this is often overlooked by many women. I think in the latter, my representations of these people were also answering more. So it was more like a discussion whereas first it was more like me listening to some people.  Emotionally, I remember feeling very soft and empathic with males and rather harsh and argumentative with the females. The latter was also more stressful and agitative...  Regarding agency within the MW, I feel like it started rather rapidly, triggered by the topic. I felt more passive in the first part, and more like I was actively forced to provide good arguments in the second. Maybe I was even more attentive and involved because of that.
I could see  the people every once in a while, maybe a picture of them sitting in front of me. But it felt like a byproduct and not of great importance. Even though the whole thing felt serious, I was not anxious or really bothered. It felt like a welcome way of daydreaming and investigating my own thoughts on this topic. ",This feels like a perfect example of how I perceive my overall MW style - but maybe only because I chose it purposefully

I was just reading like one sentence per page, many memories emerged immediately. But In the moment of the beep, I was in one particular memory and it was also a very very short episode, maybe amounting to 5-10 seconds. ","It was a very passive remembering of a specific situation during holidays in austria this summer in july. we were at a lake and suddenly a small truck/transporter came that was called the ""bible-mobil"". People got out of it and started building up a proper stage for a holy mass to start. It was mostly young people. Back then I was curious and surprised because I've never seen something like this before. And I remember me and my girlfriend kinda laughing at them.  This memory was elicited by reading these few lines and lasted only a few seconds until the beep came. But in general, I was in a nostalgic mood from reading many notes like this within the minutes before. But after each one, I decided to step out of MW and read the next one. This is also why I think agency and control are not so reliable in this example.  I was kind of allowing myself (but did not decide!) to drift away with each memory for a short time. but of course, I wouldn't know how this particular episode would have developed. I experienced it as very cozy, I saw the sun, my girlfriend and the funny bible-mobil. I would even say it was more visual (almost purely) than I perceive my MW usually.

I was playing around with this thought before, how it would be to live somewhere completely different, what I would do, if I could afford it etc. But this was only the introduction to my mind wandering. Actually, I was already out of these thought, but they triggered thinking about money and more recent plans that I have about the time when I'll be back in vienna.

I was not really imagining myself in different situations/simulations but I was in a very calculator-like-mindset. I was thinking about numbers and salary, also about living expenses and how much a normal job would take away the possibility to travel. Maybe with this topic there was a slight negative emotion but the overall mood was still very neutral.I was sitting very still and thinking, hearing my own thoughts (I'm not entirely sure about that) and staring into the dark garden without focus.

Because she sat in front of me, it felt exactly like a normal argument would feel, but only the modality of talking was in my mind. 

I was, as stated above already, very upset, angry and felt like I could not express myself to the degree I wanted to. It felt like my impulses were held back in chains and I need to restrain myself because I could hurt the other person with my words. I was also bodily intense.

I formulate these sentences in an ""I-form"" like: I am... I know that... I can not... I will always... I need...

That realization was a very calm and deeply relaxed feeling, coming from my chest and it felt like the feeling was saying to me ""it is all going to be good"". So I came back with my thought to the present/past, thinking about him again and seing scenes from our date. Then I thought about some related feelings I had about dating, that I had some aversive feelings about men  and I felt that feeling of aversion in my body, it felt like a resistance in my body, a feeling of unwillingess in my body, like instead of allowing my feeling to flow in a straight line this feeling of aversion feels like a turn, a dead end road. I thought about where that feeling comes from, which happened automatically, I didnt thought consciously that I want to look for the reason of that feeling, it just came up. In that moment I was talking about this aversion to my therapist, I did not saw her but I knew that I was telling it to her (because I had therapy later that day I was thinking about what I will tell her the whole day already) and talking to her in my mind, I realized where the aversion comes from. That realization felt like I was reconsidering  big parts of my life (at least these part of my life that were related to dating) in the background of my mind, like in a movie where many short scences folllow each other where you dont see the scene but only the glimpse of the scene is enough to understand what was happening in the whole sequence. The realization was not very elaborate inner speech, rather confuse and dizzy, more a mixture of feelings, images and forms that showed me what I was doing wrong and I knew it was this thing that I was doing wrong because I saw and felt it but it did not feel good. The realization ( I dont want to say what it was exactly) made me feel sad, but also hopeful, because I knew from the beginning (like already the whole day) or rather I had that feeling the whole day, that this time I can do it differently  and that with him I will feel different. So in the end of the episode I felt this hope and motivation, seeing in my mind how I can change the thing that bothers me to a better state and I was seeing in my mind and at the same time feeling how I can do it differently and how different it will feel being with him the next time. The whole episode was a mixture of very good and very bad feelings, but overall positive, because I had felt the aversion building up over the last weeks and now I finally understood why and that felt very relieving.

I was lying on my back with my eyes closed. The mind wandering started when I focused on the meditation and in the beginning of the meditation when I am not in a deeper state yet it is a state of slowly fading into the meditative state and so feeling already present moments of meditation while still having a lot of everyday related thoughts coming up which gets less and less the deeper I get into meditation. It ended when I was completely lost in the meditative state not thinking about anything else.","I was lying there and feeling my body, I felt a strong tension in my neck and shoulders already several hours before that and I felt relieved that I finally had the time to concentrate on these tensions and to meditate them away. That feeling of relief was not there for long, when I felt how strong these tensions where and how much they hurt. But I knew I had to face them so I got deeper into feeling them anyways. I felt several distractions coming up, and every time a distraction - thinking about something else than feeling my body- it felt like my mind was doing a detour: the meditative state is located right in front of my face in the middle of my inner spatial field of mind that is located around my head, and the distraction drifts away the location of mind from the middle to the sides, like making a curve (better: the german word ""schlenker"") and only when I let go of the distraction the mind goes back to the middle and ends the detour. During the episode I felt several of those detours or ""schlenker"" that my thougths/mental activity made but always coming back to that location in the middle that is the meditative state, marked by a big yellow hole I see when I have my eyes closed. The detours had different characters. First, I felt distraction from wanting to think about the date I had before, I knew (unconsciously) that mind wandering about that was promising to give me a good and relaxed feeling and the urge to mind wander came from that promise that I will feel good when thinking about that. So it felt like it was teasing me, seducing, like go to this place in your mind it will feel good. So I slipped into that shortly, which felt nice, but quickly after, deeper from my own body a stronger feeling arose, a feeling of strength that was interwined with a feeling of self. This feeling feels more profound and bigger than the nice feelings about the date which feel more superficial, they are not located in my body but around it and feel more dizzy and light. This more profound feeling of strength and myself also has more power over me, it almost feels strict, like I have to act according to that feeling, but not in a negative way but in a positive way (because I know subconsciously that this is important for myself). When this feeling came up, or because this feeling came up, I thought in inner speech that this meditation now is more important than to think about sex so I came back to feeling my body and being in the middle. This kind of distraction happended one or two times more in this episode. The other kind of distraction arose from thinking about university or things I had to do. When I was realizing this form that my distractions have (like the detours from the middle) I thought about that I should sample this because it is really interesting and that made me excited because it fascinated me how my experience looked like. So first it also felt like a pleasant distraction that I should follow. This however also remembered me of all the things I had to do, and a feeling of stress came up. Now it felt really important to think through what I have to do for the mind wandering project and I also let it happen, like I allowed myself to follow that distraction (unconsciously)  because I wanted to have my thoughts sorted before going back to the meditation. This thinking was much more elaborate inner speech than the other distractions which are much more based on bodily feelings and images popping up. But then when I thought it through I also came to a point where it felt like I sorted out  what I had to do for university enough, a feeling arises like when I finish a task, a feeling of completeness, I see something like a chain that comes to its end. While this chain of thoughts related to work is located more up in my field of mind around my head, when I arrive at the end of the chain and it feels complete, my location of thinking sinks down, or falls down, lower where I can just let go or go back to the meditation, go back to the middle. .Then I focused again on the tensions in my body and directed myself to give control to the feelings that arise from my body. Then my body leads the location of my mental activity, of my feelings and the content as well, although at this point the content is only the diferent feelings in my body that arise from different locations in my body, and my conscious self feels like just observing and letting happen, not like doing something itself. The location of thinking also moves more and more away from the middle of my head (like I described in the beginning) and moves more down and then jumps or flows between different locations in my body. In the beginning this state of just observing feels a bit exhausting and I need to concentrate to not gain control again and think about something. But at some point the feelings from my body completely absorb my consciousness. I am unaware of my surroudings already at the beginning and later, when I am deeper, I feel like in a hole where my whole experience is only my body and the feelings that arise from it. ",

Even before the episode, I was very disappointed and sad about myself because I didnt perform well at ballet but I was also having thoughts that it doesnt matter wheter I performed nicely or not and that I shouldnt be to hard on myself.","I was showering before going to bed, so it felt like I was reconsidering the day, replaying what happened, especially what happened in ballet class. Because I was just about to go to bed after the shower, I felt an urge to kind of ""close"" the day, sort my thoughts about it and an urge to have a calm mind before I go to bed, it felt like some unresolved issue was pounding, which presented itself as a confused and dizzy feeling of unclear emotions and not knowing what I should think throughout my whole body and mind. 
As stated in the context, even before the episode there were ambigious emotions and thoughts present. At the beginning of the episode (or slightly before it) there was this feeling present, a mixture of sadness because I failed and a very negative feeling of failing, which felt like a threat. The threat present itself to me as a kind of falling into a black hole, a feeling of unsecurity or hole in my chest, that is very deterministic and strong but also very diffuse. So the mind wandering started when I felt that feeling of threat, and when feeling that I felt an urge to think about it and handle that feeling by thinking about it. It feels like this threat and the associated feeling in my chest almost automatically triggers this urge. The unsecurity or feeling of falling feels like it triggers the urge to do something with it, to act on it, to gain control of something that appears uncontrollable. In the hours before the episode I was thinking that I dont want to let this drag me down today and I had a very strong motivation of not letting the negative feelings gain power over my mood. So it felt like this realization from earlier came up again and it induced a feeling of ""wait"", it was kind of stopping the dynamics that were ongoing (which went into a certain direction, like negative feelings and self hate that had the dynamics of dragging me down) and to not just let these dynamics happen but to introduce a break in the dynamic and reconsider it. I actually felt this change in dynamics as a feeling in my head, like my mind was stopping and  suddenly listening attentively (better: german ""aufhorchen""), the location of my thinking in my head arose from the blurred background and became prominent in the front and up as a distinctive spot. It felt like this spot wanted to go up to have a better overview of what was ongoing and to widen its perspective as not to stay in the narrow flow of negative emotions . It was like that feeling told me (without actually hearing inner speech) ""wait, this is not the only truth"". So when that feeling came up, my thoughts were moving up (like actually spatially moving in my head), concentrating more on one spot (rather then being spread out) and gaining a brighter colour, a more yellow tone. Automatically inner speech came up, where the felt purpose was to calm myself and give a different perspective. So I heard in inner speech different arguments, or it felt like I more actively produced them, altough not completely consciously, that were telling me like ""it was not actually so bad, it doesnt matter"". In my whole body I felt this strength, motivation and security that I did not want to let the negative feelings gain power and it felt like this feeling of strength was more grounded to my body than the negative thoughts and had a direction of rising, of going up, of taking up space in my mental activity. The negative feelings more came from the left top corner over my head and had a direction of going down. So the strength arising from my body took over the space from bellow and flooded my thoughts and feelings. However it was not strong enough in the first moent to completey outshine the feeling of unsecurity, so after that there was a kind of inner argumentation going on, to figure out which feeling is more justified now. This was a recalling and reiterating my mind wandering from before where I already thought about this issue intensively and I was recalling the sentences (in inner speech) that felt most important, that felt like the conclusions of all the thoughts and new insights that I had before. It was those thoughts and new insights that made most sense to me before, that gave me the most feeling of security in a situation where I did not know how to feel, which presented itself to me as these thoughts that are the brightest in colour, take up most space in my inner field of mind and stand out the most and have most power over the feeling of insecurity in my head, grasp the most. This recalling processing felt like not just letting my thoughts flow but actively ""searching"" these thoughts that gave me a good feeling . In the background the feeling of threat was still present but was overshined by the searching for positive arguments, and it gave me an overall more neutral and calm feeling. When the feeling of threat from the negative emotions was not so strong anymore, the mind wandering felt less deep, having less intensity and less urgency and I came more to an everyday mindset that did not have any specific purpose (like before where there was this strong felt purpose of calming myself and counteracting negative feelings). At this point I also realized that I was mind wandering and I drifted of to think about how to sample this epiosde.",

It started when I layed in bed and closed my eyes and it ended when I fell asleep. ,"I was laying in bed in the middle of a stressful day but I had to take a nap because I was too tired. When I closed my eyes, it happened automatically that thoughts are starting to arise. They came from the distance around my head, and they moved towards my face, like trains, not rushing but slowly fading in. It is toughts in inner speech about the things that stress me out most at the moment, especially I was thinking about things I still have to do for university and how much it is and all the situations where I potentially could have done something wrong, like didnt answer my one friend on whatsapp. When the thought comes and hits me, I have a direct somatic reaction to it, I fell my heartbeat rising and I fell pressure and stress in my body. Then I talk to myself in inner speech, and reconsider the situation, to show myself that I didnt do anything wrong or that I will be able to fix this problem if I did something wrong. The voice comes from inside me, its rising from my throat and then spreads out in my head, and the voice is really soft. To make the calming effect of the voice even stronger I direct myself to feel my body, where a feeling of strength and trust arises. When the feeling of stress from one thought gets less and a good feeling spreads out in my body and I start relaxing, the next train of thoughts is arriving from somewhere distance around my head and hitting me with the rising heartbeat.In the beginning the thoughts have more power and seem more urgent, because they induce more stress, feel closer to my body spatially and more real and vivid and as such they also feel like being ""bigger"" in the space they take. They hit me like really and I cannot ignore them even if I would want to. The longer I am in this process of calming myelf, the less power and urgency these thoughts have, and content wise it is moving to some smaller issues and so the effect on my body, when the thought arrives in my head, is also less. Then, topics that came up in the beginning are raised again when they dont feel resolved yet. This process continues until I feel more calm and then my thoughts start to get dizzy mindwandering when I am already half asleep. ",

This led to memories of the last year where I had similar feelings. I saw for a short while images of the head of people that were involved in those feelings and some very blurred vision of the place where the situation took place last year, but also the years before that were present I felt, just the latest instance was dominant in the mental vision. I felt this aversion in me to let this feeling take control of me and I blocked it away, which feels like inducing a strong positive feeling of strength in myself that now fills up my body and thus pushes away the other feeling. It feels like mentally clenching my fist (""meine Faust ballen""). This changes the course of my mind wandering and I start seeing iamges of friends and good situations where that feeling was not present and this was accompanied by a warm and nice feeling in my body.

","Before the beep I was in an episode, imagining to be a psychologist in jail for expressive arts. I was thinking about how I would react to the boys when they are impolite and overall how I would approach them. It was mainly inner speech, and some of it fully formulated, so as if I would actually talk to these people and it also felt like talking to the boys in jail rather than talking to myself, so more pronounced language (phonology and grammar is more sophisticated than inner speech to myself when I am just thinking). Still the scenes were jumping, so it was not one coherent storyline but several short scenes. The inner speech was compared with very blurred images, so almost only shapes, of the boys in jail that I was talking to. In the same very blurred way I saw myself from third perspective, but as opposed to the boys I could see my face, And it was switching between first and third person perspective. I also saw myself gesturing. The way I was talking to them was companied by a   feeling of strength. I was thinking about how I will explain them Art therapy and why it is so important. IN this part of the episode it was less elaborate inner speech and I was more jumping from word to word, innerly reconsidering my psychology knowledge that I would put into it. I felt secure about what I would say to them about this topic, so it was automatically skipped and did not had to be fully formulated. I just felt that I knew it and it felt like all my education was in that feeling. However then I felt this feeling of insecurity, that my points are not strong enough and that boys will not believe them, so I was searching for better words to bring across my point. Here, it was more elaborate inner speech again. There was this strong will to find the right formulation and words to persuade the boys to work with me. I dont know where this urge came from.",

That feeling of my body accompanying the movement had a very dynamic shape liek a wave that I felt i my chest and arms. Then I was distracted because I wondered what bending means translated to german and I was hearing some syllables of potential german words, like humming them, several after another and waiting for a german word to come up, while repeatig the english word to myself. It is a state of concentration and actively searching for something rather than just letting the words come to me like usually.

I was nervous about that because I didnt want to date him again but rather meet him as friend but I was not sure if he felt the same. So, in the mind wandering epiosde I was arguing with myself what I should text him and wheter I should tell him beforehand that out meeting isnt a date to me. I was formulating in inner speech several versions of the text messages I could sent him, stating that I only want to meet him as a friend. That inner speech was my own voice and had a very friendly intonation (probably because I wanted to write him a very friendly message, because I was afraid that he would be hurt). In the background the whole time there was this feeling of nervousness that he will be hurt because he thinks it is a date. This was an unsteady feeling in my chest, that introduces a feeling of restlessness in my mind. I also saw shortly in the background images of him and how he smiles nicely which gave me this ambivalent feeling because it reminded me that he was a nice person which gives me a good feeling but at the same time this would make it even worse to hurt him so this feeling has an up-down character, it first goes up and then down, it first introduces an open feeling in my heart and then a closed feeling because of the guilty conscience.

One quick moment later there was an unwillingness to now think about these sad topics, which I didnt actively produced, but before the episode there had already been this motivation to think positive today. That unwillingness felt like it came up from my chest, but I didnt really recognized it consciously, but my mind quickly switched topic without me infuencing it.

It was a very small club so I always knew a lot of people there and it was always a very homely atmosphere, like when you are surrounded by friends and people you like and that feeling from back then came back up and I felt that feeling quite strongly. So I thought I could ask that one friend of mine if he wants to come, it just came up, an image of his face where he smiled nicely and friendly and I was in inner speech planning how I would text him. Then I was reminded of the last evening I spent with this friend, which was a few days ago, and I saw how we were sitting in the kitchen together with other friends. It had been a really nice evening and I laughed a lot on that evening so that feeling of just pure laughing came up again, a warm and open feeling in my chest, very outgoing, like moving away from my body. I saw an image of myself in that kitchen laughing. I stayed in that memory for a while, it felt like wallowing (“suhlen”) in that memory. It was a cosy and nice feeling in my head that I didn’t wanted to leave but think more about that evening.

But it only came up very shortly and I thought like fuck it what the people think. It was mainly unsymbolized thought and that feeling of being judged feels like something is coming close to me, like invading my personal space that I feel around myself, I feel how this area that I feel around me gets narrowed when I feel judged. Even though it was a rather sad memory, it didnt feel so sad because I knew that the fight was over now and so the dominant feeling was rather a feeling of relief, like positive and going forward. it felt like I was reconsidering or confirming my decision about my relationship with my dad and by replaying those memories in the mw epsiode, I felt confirmed by myself that I took the right decision because I felt that feeling of relief, a calmness in my body that is settling.",

I also thought about the plants that grow there, but more in unsymbolized thought, I just knew that there would be plants that I really like and that I would find them pretty, even though I didnt know what plants, there were only some short blurred images of some japanese plants that I know. In the very back of my mental activity I was thinking in unsymbolized thought about some books from my favorite japanese author and it felt like some part of my mind was in those books in that moment, like how I felt when I red the books, but it werent particular memories of specific scenes from the books but like a summary from all the scenes in the books where I imagined japan to be nice and felt an urge to go there. That was kind of entangled with recalling some asian art that I had looked at a few days ago and I felt that feeling that this kind of art gives me, a feeling of excitement and longing. These images just attract me and just induce that strong urge to have more of that. It almost feels like a little hole in my chest (better german ""ziehen in der brust"") that opens up and wants to be filled with inspiration. Usually this makes me feel restless, but in that moment I was just really calm because somehow I knew during the whole episode that I will go to japan at some point, I felt like I decided this unconsciously at some point during the epsiode.

It was as if I was imagining all the gifts I got for my family - curling iron for mom, shampoos for dad, some nice wine. It did not obscure my vision though, I was still seing the lights clearly. It looked as if I was seeing the pictures or photos of the products but they were translucent. Then I though about the reactions of my family - this time I heard their voices, they were very real, as if they would be sitting next to me, but talked quite loudly. The images were not there, I was seeing the light - but mostly just the line. There started to be a bland of voices - my father, mother and brother, but my brothers voice was sticking out, sounding kind off dissapointed. The more he talked the more I couldn’t heart the other voices. I could not tell you what the voice sounding like my brother was saying, but I knew his voice sounded sad and dissapointed. I didn’t see the voice or see any particular things that would remind me of it. This voice was not coming from next to me, but from “my head” specifically back of my head. I felt my anxiety rise and felt very uncomfortable, almost similar to a feeling when I would want to start crying but can’t. I would say I almost felt cold. There was also some other feeling, but I couldn’t place it as my sampling alarm would sound. I am not sure how the mindwandering ended, sunddenly the alarm overwhelmed everything - I just remember thinking that the lights are “clearer” in shapes and I could see my surrounding being sharper.",

We were talking about our Dorm keeper and his non-reliability, as we asked him many times to fix our stove. I was lying on the bed on my stomach and someone said that no one can even boil a water there. That point is where I think I started mind-wandering. The end of the mind-wandering was I think due to my roomates, who caught my interest/focus. I couldn’t pinpoint specifically what it was, but I think it was the movement of standing up of one of them.","My mind-wandering started when I was thinking about how I was missing my cattle from home. I could see it in front of me, as if you would show me a picture of it. It was a cattle from my parents home - the cattel itself was very sharp, but the rest of the background (my vision) was a bit blurry and smokey, I would say. I felt a bit sad, looking at the cattle. While I was “looking” at the cattle a voice in my head sounded - “maybe I should buy one here”. Then an answer came - “what would you do with it when you leave”. Both voices sounded like mine and were sounding very simillar. I honetly don’t remember specifics, but one was argumenting for a me to buy a cattle and the other was very skeptical and against it. I was also vaguelly aware that the conversation around me was still going, but I could not pinpoint specific voices - I just knew that there was a sound and that sound was conversation. Although both of those voices did not sound really emotional in particural. At one point (I have no idea when, I am sorry) I stopped seeing the cattle and just heard the voices. They sounded as if they came from the “back of my head”. I was seeing just a blurry image of the “world” - as if you had tears in your eyes - you could see the world, but it would be quite blurry. At some point one of my roomates stood up - and the schift of red (he wore red hoodie) caught my attention. It was very quick, like the sheet of water would fall in front of my eyes and it was gone.",

I was making a plan of what do to in the rest of the evening. As I was scrubbing my head I was thinking about getting a tea when I got out of shower I think that is when I started to mind wander. Again, I am not certain when the mind wandering ended, I have a feeling because the water felt too cold for me at one point and that kind of forced me out of it.","When I thought about making the tea I was thinking to myself - “Well, when I get home I am so excited for my boyfriend to take care of me”. Then I started to imagine that he would make and bring me a tea - it was as if a movie or a video would be played right in front of me and I was third person spectator. I was seeing a slowly moving video of him making the tea, pouring the hot water and putting the bag in. The whole “picture” just felt very homely and warm to me. I think I enjoyed the “movie”. There was o moment of when I could stop mind-wandering, I think I would describe it as a pauze of the moving picture. And I had this feeling that I would really enjoy if I continued - and I remember thinking, like my voice would say: “what else is there?”. Then there were more pictures/movies - altough not as slow, some of them were memories and some of them were just familiar. This time there was less of background, it was mostly just my boyfriend laughing, or reaching for my hand (I could not see my hand, just him with outstreched hand) and some other which I cannot recall. It felt very relaxed, I loved seeing the pictures. I don’t know if I was thinking in verbel sense, but I just did not want it to end. The thing I think ended my mind-wandering was the goosebumbs from the cold water. The images turned at first more misty and unclear and then dissapeared very very quickly, like in snap of fingers. I remember I felt very dissapointed that the mind-wandering ended.",

I rested my cheeck on my hand and kind of lean forward on the table. I looked at it and it was about job offers in my home city for my field of expertise. I scrolled through and found one that I could actually apply for. It was assistant of psychologist - as I read the requirements I started to mind-wander. The mind-wandering ended with my roomate opening the door to our room. She openes them quite roughly and it’s quite jarring sound.,,"When I started to mind-wander it was from the third person perspective. It was quite slow in it’s start. It was as if like a sheet of water would come up over my eyes. It was from down to the top. Then there would be images which were quite vivid in color, but were very hazy in apperance and kind of very general. I could see myself walking in the halls of the institute, but you could not tell what is the institution, but in my head I knew it was the one from the application- then it would change quite abruptly, like it would swirl a bit - and I would see me administrating some psychological test to a person, I could not tell you if this person was woman or men and it was not really important, the only sharp “object” in the memory was me, I am not sure if the other person had even face - then it would change again - and I was standing in a hall with some people I know respected me, again I just saw a crowd, but never individual faces or anything specific really. I just saw hazy sillulets of people. I think there were more images, but I am not sure what they were. Overall the images were hazy around the edges and quite fuzzy. During the whole mind-wandring I felt those emtions of happiness, but also self-importance and self of achievement. I think from the mind-wandering took me the sound of the handle. I remember physically flinching in my seat. If I would have to describe it I would say the mind-wandering was “snatched” from me, as if one would just take a sheet and quickly pull it away."

The end of my mind-wandring was my sampling alarm.,,"I was looking at the ham, and thinking about my selfishness for buying it. I think I felt bit emberrased in that moment. When I started thinking about the pig that had to die for this I imagined quite big pink pig with a we snout. I would describe it like a short video of said pig, that was looking at my face straight away. “Maybe I should stop eating meat” - this sentence sounded as my voice inside my head. It felt and sounded bit guilty. The picture of the pig was not there anymore, but everything seem kind of hazy and fuzzy. At the same time I had a feeling it would be hard to be without meat - this feeling was not accompanied by voice or image, it was simply a feeling (I am sorry I tried to describe it better, but I just can’t). “How could the vegans do it” - this sentence I could again hear as my voice in my head. There was only one voice and I knew it was mine and the same one as before. It was almost as if it was echoing even. Then the alarm sounded and I have no idea how the mind-wandering ended - it was so abrupt and loud that I got scared and ran to turn it off. The only thing I know is that there were about 3 more ingrediants on the sandwich that I have only vague recollection of adding there. Also I think that the mind-wandering would go further if the alarm didn’t sound."

I was reading my material for exam I had coming up the next day. I was ttying very very hard, since my mind seemed like it was not processing the words as I wanted. I think (and that is truly a intuition), that my mind wadering started when I looked heard a loud noise from outside (like a when you would take something heavy and drop it). I turned my head and looked to my balcony. That is where I think my mind-wandering started. It ended quite slowly I would say and I would even say that maybe I was the one who pushed myself out of the mindwandering. It was my voice that “woke me up”.","The MW started when I heard a loud noise. The MW came quite quick - I was seeing the world as if I had put a wrong pair of glasses on. It was a bit blurry, but there were still shapes. Like, I saw that there were two colorful shapes somewhere far in my vision. Although if you would ask me at that moment, I would not know what it is. The colors were not mixing or moving or anything. If something moved during my MW I have not noticed it. I know that there was something there, which I don’t remember, there was like a thought, but I am not able to place it. Then I started thinking about my uncle. There was no visual, just my voice and feeling. I felt so heavy and tight. The tightness and heaviness was felt the most in my chest. It felt very claustrophobic. There was also this sense of helplesness. I heard my voice - but I would devide it into 2 voices which were arguing. Basically the first was very sad, very regretful and was saying that he could have lived so much longer. The other one was not as emotional, and literally argumented back that uncle was in pain and there was nothing to do. I have not seen the voices. It felt as if they were coming from “the back of my head”. The whole “debate” in my head was quite “impersonal” maybe because I was just a listener to this and did not participate. My MW ended when the rational voice said something in the sense: “let him rest and be. It was better for him”. I don’t know why, but something in that sentence really pushed on me - meaning suddenly I had this great urge to do something (not anything specific really). I think that is when I turned my head and my vision sharpened bit by bit and that is when the MW ended.",

I started to looking around to car to see where to start lights and then looked for other stuff. I am not not sure what, but I couldn’t find something and that triggeret MW.

I could see myself struggle (in 3rd person) with the car - that the scene would change - Me driving the car and having problems - again it changed - me having an car accident. I know there was more, but I don’t remember what. The changes were very quick and abrupt, it was as you see in the old black and white movies where there are like “windows” on the movie tape, that seemed to me what I was looking at, a very long tape. The whole time I felt very anxious and it was rising. I felt my stomach as if it was “alive” and hurting a lot. The color were also quite gloomy, everything seemed more blue, grey and black than anything else. I had no cotrol whatsoever over this MW. There was not even a thought for me to get out. I just remember this acceptance of my fate, that there is no changing it. My MW ended with relatively quick. I felt as if someone would put a rope around my braind and did a sharp yank to the side. I remember everything basically “falling” to the left. As if someone would pull it from my eyesight. ",

The MW ended when someone said my name (I think it was dad) and told me what to buy from the supermarket.","When I heard my uncles name there was very slow start to the MW. I started thinking about the people around him - in my head I could hear several voices saying his name (my aunt, his sons, my mom..). They were just saying his name and nothing more - but I had this sense of kindness and love that I felt. The voices were “in my head” and I would say they echoed quite lot. Also it was very repetative - the name was being call over and over. It felt like this lasted quite a while and at one point started to be accompanied by “pictures”. It was as if I was seeing a home made movie of very very short snippets of my uncles life. The scenes were changing, but it was not abrupt, it felt very calm and natural. There was he laughing, then drinking beer, than writing on computer, than telling jokes. Basically all of those things I remember him doing so many times in his life. The pictures themself were quite soft, almost in pastel colors and a warm light. The end of my MW was quick, but I would not call it abrupt. I heard my name while looking at the pictures shown. I turned my head to the sound and as I do, everything turned to colorful mix…it was as if the color just poured into themselfs.

I was listening to modern music but remade more classical and instrumental. I had my eyes closed and just wanted to rest for a while after learning. I was very tired and also bored from everything I had (or more like haven’t had) done. That is when my MW started. I think my MW ended when I was not able to think of anything else. It seemed as if I myself was bored of it and decided to end it.,"As I was hearing the music I started wondering what dance would be best suited for this kind of tempo. You could basically hear my voice analyzing the music like: “no, it’s too fast paced for it”. I could just hear myself talking to me and then there was this change it the tone of music to a very lovely piece and I remember just thinking: “wouldn’t it be better if I was a dancer?”. Then the image would start to form about myself - I could see myself and felt almost as if I would be playing a video game. I was able to “follow” myself. I had beautifull red dress on and was dancing with someone. I would not be able to describe the persons face or anything really apart from black trousers and white shirt. There was nothing around us, no people and I have no recollection of any wall. Just the floor, which was very shiny. I was watching myself dance for some time. It was from 3rd person view. It felt like a video game in sense that I could feel the want and need for them to do a flip or a turn or something cool and the pair (myself and someone) would do it. That is how I would manipulate them on the dancefloor, always wanting to see something interesting. At one point thought I noticed that the turns and tosses and moves were still the same and even though I wanted them to do kick/turn - it was all still the same. I think I felt quite frustrated and bored and just remember hearing myself say (as if I was speaking out loud): “what’s the point then”. That is when the pictures basically dissapeart. Like in snap of a finger I was suddently in complete darkness. Before the pictures dissapeared completely they were already quite shaky and “wobbly”(?). It seemed like they did not hold shape very well and were already falling apart.",

The voice started quite in the background, but seemed as if it was getting closer. Like someone would talk 10 meters behind me. and as he talking he would come right behind me. The voice though seemed to be coming from my head. As the voice was getting more clear and lounder (to the volume you normally speak) my friends was was starting to be more like a buzz or just something there I knew was going on, but could not put my finger down on what. I could still see normaly and sharply, I could see my friends face as clear as day. The voice I was able to recognise as mine. As it spoke it seemed deep in thought and very calm. The voice/or myself - I am not sure ho to reffer - was debatung with itself when should I write to my friend, if I should call her if she is alone on Chrismas, maybe I should sent her something? Everytime the voice would consider the plus and minus - that she will be glad I chencked in, but she might not feel well enough to call, maybe I should just write sms. The whole time the voice was debating the options, I felt my head nodding to the humming sound that I just knew was my friend. Suddenly I knew that my friend needed answer. I think it was the weird intonnation of the question that threw me out of the mind wandering. It just felt very wrong somehow and at that time I knew I needed to answer.",

I was very frustrated and just disgusted with myself, the subject and the teacher. To be honest I have no recollection what so ever of how this MW started.

I was not aware of my surroundings at all. And to be honest I could not poin out if I was seeing it at all. What I did feel/hear was this buzzing. The buzzing was as if you would hear a few hundred bees flying around. This buzzing had 2 tones which were alterning, more intense and less intense. If there was a pattern to these changes I was not able to recognise it, it seemed very random to me. This was going on for some time, but to be honest it seemed like a very short time. I would say maybe no more than half a minute. Then the buzzing changed, it was getting more and more intense, but everytime it would be by levels. The tone and intensity of the buzzing would change to higher/stronger and than stay like that for some time. Then it was again more intense and stronger and waited for some time. The intensity did not made me feel any type of way, not negative and not positive. I was just there to be honest. As the buzzing was stronger and stronger I think I would at that point describe it as the sound of maybe thousand of bees. At that point the alarm rang. It startled me quite a lot and I have no idea how the MW ended. There was literally nothing in my brain at that point.

There was a voice in my head saying: “hmm, what should I do with it?” And proceeded to think about different hairstyles. I would hear my voice say: “ponitaily (or curls, straight hair)” and than would come a certain feeling. Like with the curls there would be feeling of annoyance or with ponytail there was a feeling that it is just not right. I was looking at my hair and the voice again said “hmm, maybe I should cut it…but not before the wedding”. The voice was quite thoughtful and I did not sense any emotions from him, it seemed quite analytical. Up until that point my vision was quite clear and I think I was quite aware of my hand movement. Then I think the word “wedding” started something. My vision would glaze over, as if you would look through very thin sheet of water. Then I would start seeing pictures or images of myself and my boyfriend at the alter. It was looking very regal and elegant - I had wedding dress and he did suit. I didn’t see them, but I knew there were tons of people around us. For some reason it made me very emotional and very happy. The me in the picture also seemed very emotional and almost crying. The visual was quite warm and fuzzy around the edges. I could not tell you much from the scene apart from description of me and my boyfriend, but I remember the color light pink as very prominenet. Then a voice which seemed kind of sad said: “well, you will have to wait for that for a bit”. I think there was a feeling of slight confusion on my part, but I could not tell you specifically about what, I just felt it.

It seemed as if we were almost falling asleep and the scene looked very cozy. I was watching it as if someone would show me a short video or a moving photograph. Then the second image came and it was of me and my friends at our cottage sitting on the floor and talking. I recognised it as the cottage right away as it has a signature fireplace I could recognise. Again the picture felt very warm and was bathed in warm light. I could also hear laughter from my friends, but it did not come from the picture I could see in front of me, but it came from the back of my head. As if they would sit far away behind me.

I heard the voice speak about my relationships and starting to compare my relationship and my communication to my partner. I felt this overall sense of pride about my relationship. I felt very happy and content at that moment. The voice was speaking both arguments - basically saying that we have both flaws, but also many many strenghts.

The voice, which sounded like mine, seemed very analytical as it judged the competence and characteristics of my family and friends. It would always say their name and then something in the lines of: “hmm, no I don’t think she would cover for me - she is too just and faur for that”. I was very much agreeing with the voice.

Just me watching as a spectator of a life of someone else. I could feel big sense of pride and self-importance. Like I was doing a great job. Without any auditory or any sound at all, I knew people were saying that about me, as much as I knew that they respected me.

The episode is basically mostly unsymbolized inner speech about some concepts: cultural norms, how much other guests I know might give, my personal principles, etc.The goal is to make a deicison on how much money I have to give to keep a good relation to this friend, not embarras myself, but also not damage my budget. My thoughts feel completely chaotic with all this unsymbolized concepts just being present there, and there are so many, also mixed with feelings like shame (if I don't meet cultural norms but also because of the primitive stupid cultural norms that you have to give your kidney when someone's getting married), how I can't put something like 70 euros because a 20 euro bill will look cheap, I also have some again unsymbolized comparison of the friends I made in Europe and this particular circle of friends from home, and how I would never feel this kind of shame/pressure/frustration over money in front on my European friend group, etc. There are many other things going on there like evaluation of my freindship with the bride, the length of our friendship and it's changing dynamics over the past 13 years, etc. And all these thoughts I feel them as if they have some physical weight, my body is more and more tense, I have a need to shut down or discharge somehow, but at the same time there is some meta process of self-scolding for taking this whole thing so dramatically... It is possible that some of these things appeared in other modalities, there was some hard-to-access visual imagery of this friend, and some scenes we've been together, but this is very blury, I am not sure about it.

It resembled a dream because I never knew what is going to happen next, like in reality, my predicting abilities were very limited. However, I was aware of myself being in bed in my room in Ljubljana, which is how I know I was somewhat awake. The storyline went like this:

I was in together with my friend Dragana and we were about to go out to the city. I had a thought how I miss doing that with her since she got a child, and how this is nice, but I don't remember experiencing it too emotionally. In the house of the friend, there were here sister who just came from the US, me, and some people. The sister is taller than me for almost a full head, and I spend some time letting that sink in. Also the sister is wearing a floral dress which I recognize as mine. Then, i ask that friend to see her and her partner's wedding rings. She shows me to take a tiny box from some surface. There are two tiny boxes, one I recognize as mine from Tunis, and the other one has a lock. I open them both and find some wedding rings in the one with a tiny lock. The rings are inside but I don't see them it's blury. The friend is showing me now a reciept for her wedding rings and I see that one costs 540 euros. I think to myself what an idiot I am with my 50 euros in the envelope for their wedding. Dragana and I leave their house and we have a bottle of wine. I know we bought it along the way although I didn't have a visual image of the scene when we did it. We keep walking and I receive a voice message from another friend. As i take my phone out and we listen to it, I can see Dragana walking in front of me, and I can see that we are now near the forest in my neighborhood in Belgrade. I have some feelings in my chest with that realization, but I don't know what they are. The sound of the voice message keeps going in the background, I put the other hand in my pocket and realize that I have TV remote control inside that I picked up from the friend's apartment. Dragana reassures me that it's okay that we go back to give it back. All of a sudden I have a rush of familiar feelings that have no name, it's just a feeling of going out in Belgrade in the evening... what that city feels like, what moving from my neighborhood towarads the centre feels like... As these feelings come to my awareness, I become aware also of the fact that it's warm outisde, like spring/summer night, and it feels just right but i think that I am actually melancholic",

I feel upset, in my body and in my mind, I feel it in my chest. The mind wandering is about me receiving a phone call that my mom died, had a car accident, or stroke at home. Very fast-paced I have all three of these separate scenarios. I am in Filip’s house in Bratislava and this is very visual, I see the flat, his family is at home. In my mind it’s as if I rehearse how to withhold an emotional reaction to this. However, even though i am only mind wandering, I feel like my chest is tight, also in reality, I have a buzzing sound in my ears, and it’s hard to breathe. The perspective switches from first to third person and back, I replay this scene again and again, and I am I think trying to in my episode to make myself leave the flat without expressing emotions, but then I imagine myself fainting, I feel in my hands and my face the numbness, and I burst into tears in my MW episode and also in real life. The ring happened somewhere along this episode, it wasn’t too long, but it had lots of content.
I tried to stop this episode and i was aware of mind wandering, but it was impossible, it was flowing like a river, and i had to let it play. After that i ruminated over my guilt for leaving the country and ruminated fear of being unable to help my mom if something happens to her.

This presence of my self has looked at the scene from my eyes. It felt like a miniaturized magnifying glass with the same perception. The tension that set the scene in motion began in my stomach and built up, taking more and more space until it reached my mind. Then I heard a kind of click, like a lighter opening, without seeing it as an image in front of me and suddenly the buildings were framed with fire. Curiously i remember that a silent voice in my brain ask me why the flames are around the houses like a cover but not really burning them down. However, this was really only briefly. I felt like I created the scene myself, although I was drawn in more by the buildup of tension. Therefore, I had a sense of power over the scene, nonetheless I didn't stop it myself. It was just gone in one fell swoop and I was back to looking at the normal buildings without the mental image of it. The weird part was that all this were covered in the lyrics of the song. But i cannot remember what the lyrics was in these few seconds. It was more as if the music were played in the background to underline the scene. ",

I was there, but only as an essence not as a participant. I walked next to the protagonist and observed what is going on, but I didn´t interact. There was no spoken word, more like a non-verbal exchange of impressions. I felt as if i should do something but i didn´t know what, except of absorb what is shown to me. Something hold me in the pictures. I had the sense that I should be there and on the other hand I could not enter. This made me sad but  also relieved. The feeling of relieve brought me a positive vibe and strengthened me in the certainty to simply stay where I am, although I could not help there.

My attention shifts to the conversation in my head. This shift is sudden. It was not provoked by any association. It just happens and comes out of nowhere. Like a force that transports you to another atmosphere, another story.
I cannot see clearly what is going on, but there is an awareness that tells me what is going on and where I am. I am in the picnic area (zone 70), two months ago. I know this place; I am convinced I have been there before. It is so strong feeling that I know this place, is real. I cannot see a sharp image, but the feeling tells me it's sunny and hot. I believe this is just memory and I am reliving it right now. I see myself from a 3-person perspective. I lean on the table and say something to a colleague. I hear myself saying, ""I have had enough for today, let us go home."" I am seeing this from a bird's eye view. I see the top of the tent and the top of our hands turning toward each other and moving our hands. It's like looking down on us from a tall tree. And we look small. I flip through my speech three times from beginning to end. 
The impressions of the picnic area begin to fade, my vision focuses back to the path. I hear the question, ""Are you even listening to me?"" I am aware that it has carried me away. Now I see everything with my own eyes. I apologize to my boyfriend and begin to think about my mind wandering. Why and how it brought me to that particular memory. My conclusion is that I do not know.
Now my attention is back on the road.

After seeing this scene in my mind's eye, the question arises as to whether there would be any effect if actors protested against the script. The question isn't an inner speech, but somehow appears formlessly in me. This is followed by the conclusion that a single actor would probably have a poor chance of success.

Just for a brief moment, I think back to how we used to be at a fun park as a family and lost my little brother for a few minutes. This memory is less in spoken language than in pictures but rather as an inner knowing and a memory of the feelings. After that flash of memory, I wonder what I would do now if my little brother were lost. Immediately after this thought comes a new one, which this time is more verbal: What can I do so that we can find each other again if we lose each other. (Context: My brother doesn't have a cell phone). The next thought accompanied by slightly worried emotions: How do you find each other in a city you don't know and a language you don't speak and if you don't even know the address where you live. My brain seems to be going through the different variables of this question looking for a solution. It's less something active and more like I'd set a stone rolling that is now rolling on by itself. The first solution that results from the question is that my brother knows for sure what the address of our apartment is. The MW ends with me asking my brother if he knows our address.
Even though I didn't directly address my brother in my mind during this process, he seemed somehow present.

When it was over: I was internally satisfied with the conversation. I said to myself something like: yeah, that's good, I'll tell her like this. So I broke it off at my own sense of satisfaction from the conversation.","

As it appeared to me: While I was waiting, I was replaying in my head everything that had happened in my day, and I was already composing the sentences in my head as if I had already told my friend. So I tried to recall everything that had happened to me that day, and I tried to recount it to myself in a way that would come out funny and draw her into the story. I dropped and rose my voice in different ways, playing with the tone of my voice and lengthening some of the words. While I was setting up and thinking about the day, I always had a picture in my head for a moment of what I wanted to talk about. I always pictured it and saw it in front of me. Sometimes I even answered myself, but they were short answers.",

I'm used to travelling in the summer in a van where we have a built-in van, so it brought back memories of summer. Suddenly a feeling of warmth washed over me and it was as if I had been transported somewhere else. Suddenly I was back in the mountains and in my car, experiencing the beauty of nature. 

How it ended: it ended with me no longer being satisfied with the idea and no longer finding it fulfilling or fun, so my mind moved on again.","How did it seem to me? It was a video, my imagination was running wild. I imagined driving past beautiful countryside in the van and seeing forests, rivers and meadows. Everything was beautifully green. The feeling of it all warmed me, I felt very calm in that moment. But what was always etched in my imagination was what I saw on the way. It started first with the image of me riding in the van with my boyfriend, and then I added everything I saw from the bus window to the story (for example, I saw a nice road from the bus window, so I imagined us driving along it too)","The very first impulse when I saw the van was not positive. My first thought was that someone must be smuggling something in there and that it looked suspicious, but this negative feeling didn't last long in me as I told myself I was just paranoid from watching a horror movie the night before. So, subsequently, I've taken my imagination in a different (nicer) direction. So it didn't evoke nice emotions in me at first and I felt rather uncomfortable and retreated into myself. "

All of a sudden, I started watching my palm. I think this was prompted by noticing that I had quite a few visible calluses from my workout and then shifting my attention to my entire palm.","
How did it appear to me? In my head, I imagined I was looking at a map. My fingers were peninsulas - sort of like the fjords in Norway. The lines on my palm represented rivers, and in between my imagination was going full blast, so there were suddenly green meadows and little houses with red roofs. Then I started to move my palm in different ways, creating different waves of this landscape and changing it in this way. It all appeared to me visually - I could see it very clearly in front of me and gradually more and more things were added to it. 
All of a sudden my palm started to sweat a lot. That was also the moment when my imagination ended, because I suddenly felt that everything I had built up on that palm was being washed away from my palm by the sweat, and it was all running away, and different colors were running down my palm. Most of it was green and red. After a while, when I got tired of watching the paint run down, I broke my fantasy.

They were standing together and hugging a short distance from the train one of them was supposed to take. I watched them for a while, observing the way they were treating each other. ","Subsequently, my own relationship came to mind and I began to compare the behavior of this couple and the behavior of my couple. Then my thoughts slipped to dating people and how people probably dated differently. I wondered what it would be like if I suddenly found myself in, say, the 18th century and had to go on a date. This seemed to be me talking to myself in my head and variously polemicising and playing with my thoughts. Suddenly I saw a vivid image of myself on this date and everyone around me dressed in suits and terribly old-fashioned. Then the environment around me completely changed and suddenly I was in an even older era and there were just guys around me dressed in beast skins and I went over to try and ask them out. Then I saw myself sitting with this man in a cave at a stone table. It was a terribly funny image for me, and that was the end of it for me, because I had already gone to prehistoric times, and that was a very distant image for me, and my mind knew that it wasn't worth imagining any further.  It all seemed like short videos/pictures to me and the images changed quite quickly. The emotions were positive - I felt joy, playfulness and relaxation with it. ",

I watched the video and started imagining that one day I would have that kind of form and that kind of strength too. I saw myself at a competition where I was doing different events and saw myself as a winner with a medal on the podium.

I ended up really getting up and going to work out. So it was at a point where I was feeling very pumped up already and it was to the point where I couldn't take it anymore and went to work out. My body at that moment felt the need to get up and go, which was very strong.","
As it appeared to me: this idea was visual, I saw short videos in front of me that had everything to do with the competition. There were a lot of people around me. The videos were very crisp and colorful. I could even hear the noise of others cheering me on, it was a complete roar. It gave me tingles all over my body. I felt like I had too much energy in my body that I needed to release somewhere. I was very pumped up and I would have loved to go to a competition right then and there. Just the thought of it made the muscles in my body tense up.
